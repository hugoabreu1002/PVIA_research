# ML-OPT-IA-Algorithms

Here I will keep the Algorithms that I wrote, or cool examples with packages that I found on web.

## Descriptions

* ACO.py - Ant Colony Optimization class to be run over any function
* ACO_graph.py - run ACO over a pre-defined graph
* IWO.py - Invasive Weed Optimization algorithm to run over any function.
* PSO.py - Particle Swarm Optimizatin to run over any function.
* AGEnsembleResidual.py - Hibrid model with Ensembles to correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax
* AGMLPResidual.py - Hibrid model with MLPs correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax
* AgMlp.py - AG otimization of MLPs
* EnsembleSearch.py - AG otimization of Ensembles
* GA and DE optimization examples in notebooks folder.
* TimeSeriesUtils.py - bunch of functions to help with time series.
