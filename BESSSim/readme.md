# Purpose

Simulate the Optimal Dispatch Problem for BESS.

Cost and Hourly Demand Data in the file [Cost_and_hourly_demand.xlsx](Cost_and_hourly_demand.xlsx) was took from [1].

# Possible Scenarios for BESS.

From [1].

* Scenario 1 (S1): This scenario analyzes the optimal dispatch of DCMG considering that the BESSs begin and end their daily operation in the fully discharged state.
* Scenario 2 (S2): In this scenario is considered that the BESS must begin and end their daily operation with a 50% charge. However, during their daily operation, they can discharge or charge from 0% to 100% of their nominal capacity.
* Scenario 3 (S3): In this scenario is analyzed that the BESS can only vary their nominal capacity from 50% to 100% during the day.
