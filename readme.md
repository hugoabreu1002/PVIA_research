# PVIA Research

Centralized directory for all research done for PVIA Project

## Using submodule

For the time series predictions I am also using repo: https://github.com/hugoabreu1002/ML-OPT-IA-Algorithms as submodule
in the cities folders:

* maceio

I am separating by city becouse of the data of each one, that is very specific.
This city has an example of 1 day ahead forecast, but 1 day ahead is too much seen that the forecast have to be implemented with 1 hour.
